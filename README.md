## An Examination of Alberta's COVID-19 Trends

I will be putting my newly acquired data science skills to use and exploring Alberta's COVID-19 data.

My goal is to perform some basic exploratory data analysis, create some helpful visualizations and hopefully use some basic compartmental epidemic models (SI, SIR) to get some insight into what the future holds.

The COVID-19 Canada Open Data Working Group's Interactive Dashboard is serving as my inspiration. I have also enjoyed reading Bruno Gonçalves' excellent 3-part series on Epidemic Modeling. I will be attempting to recreate some of these visualizations and models in an Alberta-specific context.

I am in way above my head in terms of data analysis and modeling, not to mention working with epidemiological data, so any input is welcome.

## Sources and References

All epidemiological data is taken From Isha Berry's GitHub repository.

Isha Berry is a PhD Candidate in Epidemiology at University of Toronto studying infectious disease transmission dynamics and global health. Isha co-founded the COVID-19 Canada Open Data Working Group in response to the need for accurate, up-to-date and accessible data on the COVID-19 epidemic in Canada. The working group collects individual-level epidemiological case data from publicly available sources and makes this data available in real-time. This dataset feeds into an interactive dashboard, which enables users to visualize pan-Canadian trends in health outcomes.
